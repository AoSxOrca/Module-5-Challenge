# Module-5-Challenge
#In the Module 5 folder you will find my code. For some reason I was having issues with the code not running at first but I changed the Kernel and it worked properly. I tested the code in Jupyter NoteBook and it worked fine as well.
I found this challenge easier to understand and execute and I am glad to be making progress in this course.
